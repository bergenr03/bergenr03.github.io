<h1>My Top 3 Favorite Speedrunning Games</h1>
    <a href="sm64.html"><h2>Super Mario 64</h2></a>
<p class="sm64">This game is an old one, but a fun one! For a game that game out in 1996, I think that it is very good for it's time. The game revolutionized the 3D aspect of video games and the movement is very good. I still think it has some of the best movement out of any video game.</p>
    <a href="Refunct.html"><h2>Refunct</h2></a>
    <p class="refunct">Refunct is a game that you can get for 3 dollars on steam and is also very short. Although it has a very short length, it is a very relaxing and calming game, and has great music! It even has a built in timer to see how fast you can beat it.</p>
    <a href="celeste.html"><h2>Celeste</h2></a>
    <p class="celeste">Celeste is probably my favorite video game of all time. It tells a great story of a girl named Madelyn's inner self trying to stop her from climbing a mountain, but she perseveres. This game also has great music and is very difficult, but once you beat Celeste, you feel a great sense of accomplishment.</p>
