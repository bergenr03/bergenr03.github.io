    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="sm64">Although this game is very old, it is the most speedrunned game of all time and for good reason. The game includes a lot of cool glitches and tricks and infinite oportunity for improvement. The beauty of speedrunning is that you can choose whatever category you want to speedrun. Here is a list of categories for Super Mario 64.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0 Star: Beat the game as fast as possible without any restrictions. The category with the least amount of runners. The hardest category of them all because it includes several very difficult glitches that allow you to beat the game without collecting any star.</li>
      <li>1 Star: The same as 0 star, except it excludes one glitch that skips a star in the game. Still very difficult.</li>
      <li>16 Star: Beat the game with the method that allows you to only collect 16 stars. Includes glitches that are very easy to learn and it is the category that is most ran.</li>
      <li>70 Star: Beat the game as the developers intended. It's basically just beating the game without any major glitches that make you skip large portions of the game.</li>
      <li>120 Star: Beat the game while collecting every star.</li>
